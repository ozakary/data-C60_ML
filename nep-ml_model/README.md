## Training process of NEP3 model

Training of a NEP model requires the input file `nep.in` and the training and testing dataset xyz-files `train.xyz` and `test.xyz`.
The internal hyperparameters of the model and the training process are controlled through the `nep.in` input file.
With the provided file structure, the training process of NEP model may be started simply with the command
```nep```
provided that **GPUMD** and **NEP** are installed.
