Diagrammatic representation of the steps used to obtain the MLIPs, including (i) building the initial configuration, (ii) performing the first round of SEMD simulations (SEMD-1) and sampling snapshots, (iii) removing the He atom and performing single point calculations at three levels of theory (DFT-1, DFT-2, and DFT-3) on the sampled snapshots to obtain the total energies (E, eV) and atomic forces (f, eV.Å^(-1)), which, together with the snapshots, constitute the three datasets DATA-1.1 DATA-2, and DATA-3, (iv) using these datasets to train NEP architecture and obtain three MLIPs (MLIP-1.1, MLIP-2, and MLIP-3), (v) performing active learning for MLIP-1.1, which involves generating more data (DATA-1.2) and merging it with DATA-1.1 to create an expanded datasets (DATA-1), which is used to retrain NEP and obtaining MLIP-1.2.
