Diagrammatic representation illustrating the CUEAL (committee uncertainty estimation-driven active learning) workflow targeting the dataset from DFT-1 level of theory. The workflow starts from step (iii) in Fig.1 and includes (i) performing single-point calculations, DFT-1, to obtain DATA-1.1, (ii) training NEP on this dataset to obtain the first-generation MLIP (MLIP-1.1), (iii) copying the checkpoint file of this MLIP-1.1 at the 200 000th training iteration into four version, MLIP-1a, MLIP-1b, MLIP-1c, and MLIP-1d, (iv) performing a machine learning MD simulations (MLMD) using MLIP-1a, (v) randomly reinitializing the internal parameters of MLIP-1b, MLIP-1c, and MLIP-1d, then resuming training for these three MLIPs using the NEP architecture to obtain the final committee models, which also include MLIP-1a, (vi) performing an on-the-fly evaluation of the atomic forces from the MLMD snapshots using the committee models and computing uncertainties, (vii) retaining only the snapshots with uncertainties above the threshold delta, (viii) carrying out single-point DFT calculations (DFT-1) on these snapshots to obtain the dataset DATA-1.2 and merging it with DATA-1.1 to form DATA-1, and (ix) training the NEP architecture to obtain the second-generation MLIP-1 (MLIP-1.2).
