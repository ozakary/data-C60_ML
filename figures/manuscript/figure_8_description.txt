Evolution of the average 13C isotropic magnetic shielding, sigma_iso (ppm), as a function of temperature, T (K), for the isotopomers 13C_1 HHP (black dots), 13C_2 CHH (blue triangles), and 13C_2 HP (yellow diamonds). The data was obtained using the NMR-ML model applied to MLPIMD trajectories generated with the MLIP-1.2 interatomic potential. The solid and dashed lines represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared value is given in the lower left corner.
