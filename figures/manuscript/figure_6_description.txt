Evolution of the average effective geometry volume, V_eff (Å^(3)), as a function of temperature, T (K), obtained from MLPIMD simulation using MLIP-1.2 interatomic potential with beads, P = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. An inset (bottom right) highlights a zoomed view of the curves corresponding to P = 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.
