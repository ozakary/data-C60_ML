Correlation plots of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) E_ML (E_DFT), and f_ML (f_DFT) for MLIP-1.2 (a and d), MLIP-2 (b and e), and MLIP-3 (c and f) from the training and validation sets of the DATA-1, DATA-2, and DATA-3 datasets, respectively. The red line along the diagonal represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE) values are given in the upper left corner.
