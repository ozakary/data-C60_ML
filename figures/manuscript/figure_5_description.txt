Histogram plots illustrating the distributions of the DFT-computed 13C sigma_iso DFT (ppm), from the training (a), validation (b), and testing (c) sets of DATA-4 dataset. Correlation plots of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) sigma_iso ML (sigma_iso DFT) for the training (d), validation (e), and testing (f) of the DATA-4 dataset. The red line along the diagonal represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, RMSE, and MAE values are given in the upper left corner.
