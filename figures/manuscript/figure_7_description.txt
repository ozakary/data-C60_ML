(a) Evolution of the average effective geometry volume, V_eff (Å^(3)), and (b) the relative volume to T = 150 K, V_eff(T) - V_eff (150 K) (Å^(3)), as functions of temperature T (K), obtained from MLPIMD simulations using MLIP-1.2 (black dots), MLIP-2 (blue triangles), and MLIP-3 (yellow diamonds) interatomic potentials, as well as data from Ref.(\cite{jacklin_quantum-mechanical_2025}) (green crosses). Each data point is associated with an error bar corresponding to the SEM as defined in eq.13.
