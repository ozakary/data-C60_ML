Statistical inefficiency of the potential energy as a function of block length obtained from an MLPIMD simulation with MLIP-1.2 interatomic potential at T = 300K and P = 32. The correlation time is estimated from the block length corresponding to the maximum statistical inefficiency, which is approximately 1000 time steps (500 fs).
