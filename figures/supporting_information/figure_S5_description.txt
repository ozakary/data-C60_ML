Training and validation progress from NEP for C_60fullerene. The figure illustrate the evolution of the training and validation loss function for the energy per atom  and atomic forces, as a function of the number of training iterations divided by 100 for MLIP-1.2 (a and d), MLIP-2 (b and e), and MLIP-3 (c and f).
