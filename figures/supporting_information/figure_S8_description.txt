Statistical inefficiency of 13C sigma_iso  from the isotopomer 13C_2 HH as a function of block length obtained from an MLPIMD simulation with MLIP-1.2 interatomic potential at T = 300 K and P = 32. The correlation time is estimated from the block length corresponding to the maximum statistical inefficiency, which is approximately 40 time steps (20 fs)
