Block figure of the flow of preparing the reference data, training the ML models, running the PIMD simulations for the analysis of the volume of C60 and the NMR chemical shielding of C60. First the reference dataset configurations are produced by running a semi-empirical MD simulation. The resulting trajectory is sampled and reference values (E , F , σ) are calculated for the samples at three levels of DFT theory. This results in three reference datasets with the reference values calculated at different levels of theory. Finally three NEP MLIP models are trained, each using one of the three reference datasets as training data. Additionally a SchNet NMR model is trained using the DFT-1 reference dataset. The three NEP MLIP models are used to run PIMD simulations for the volume analysis. The MLIP-1 model is used to run PIMD simulations for three isotopomers of C60. Samples from the trajectory are analyzed with the SchNet NMR-ML model to predict the chemical shielding.
